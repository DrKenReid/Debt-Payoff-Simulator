# 💰 Debt Payoff Simulator 📊

This repository contains a Python-based debt payoff simulator implemented in Google Colab, helping users analyze and compare different debt payoff strategies to manage and eliminate debt more effectively.

## 📋 Contents

1. **Debt Payoff Simulator**: A Google Colab notebook that simulates various debt repayment strategies such as snowball and avalanche.
2. **Debt Data Input**: Users can input their debt balances, interest rates, minimum payments, and any extra payments they wish to make.
3. **Strategy Comparison**: The simulator compares the total interest paid and the time required to pay off each debt under different strategies.
4. **Visualization**: Generates charts that visually show the impact of each strategy over time.
5. **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust inputs to see how different strategies or extra payments affect their debt repayment journey.
